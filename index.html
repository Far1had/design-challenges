            <div>
                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
                    my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
                    some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
                    phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                    sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
                    made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
                    the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

            <div>
                <h4><span><img src="./assets/img/title02.svg" alt="icon"></span>Start with asking why</h4>
                <p>You will start seeing things differently and
                    coming up with more effective ways of achieving
                    goals.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4><span><img src="./assets/img/title04.svg" alt="icon"></span>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
                <p>By looking at problems from a different
                    perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more
                    valuable.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4><span><img src="./assets/img/title01.svg" alt="icon"></span>Design solutions with love</h4>
                <p>Only when you experience a problem yourself do
                    you understand the frustration of the users and
                    resolve to end it.</p>

            <div>
                <h4><span><img src="./assets/img/title03.svg" alt="icon"></span>Share and show your work</h4>
                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing
                    work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.
                    You will learn to accept feedback and learn from
                    it.</p>

                <p>The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have
                    to create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and
                    show the result to the community.</p>

                    <p>It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys,
                        calling
                        a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay

                    <p>It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these problems? It's time to think out
                        of the box, grab your notebook and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.</p>

                    <p>How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about features and functionality,
                        and then start designing. Don’t forget to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?</p>
